# NEAT User Manual

1. Introduction
1.1 Overview

NEAT (Neutron Bragg Edge Analysis Toolkit) is an open-source Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) designed for Bragg-edge neutron imaging data analysis. It enables users to visualise, fit, and interpret wavelength-resolved transmission data collected from neutron imaging beamlines such as IMAT (ISIS Neutron and Muon Source).

The software provides a streamlined workflow that integrates data loading, edge fitting, mapping, and batch processing ‚Äî allowing both scientific and industrial users to efficiently extract quantitative information such as lattice spacing and residual strain from transmission spectra.

1.2 Purpose and Motivation

Bragg-edge imaging is a powerful neutron technique that reveals material structure and strain information through energy-resolved transmission. However, the analysis of such data is often time-consuming and requires specialised knowledge of fitting functions and image handling.

NEAT was developed to:

Simplify the analysis process for both new and experienced neutron users.

Provide a consistent and reproducible data analysis workflow.

Offer interactive visualisation tools to inspect transmission spectra, edge positions, and strain maps.

Facilitate collaboration and reproducibility through open-source code and transparent fitting algorithms.

1.3 Key Features

User-friendly GUI: intuitive layout for spectrum viewing, ROI selection, and batch analysis.

Flexible fitting functions: pseudo-Voigt model used, J√∏rgensen Bragg-edge models is planned to included in the future.

Result visualisation: generate maps of lattice spacing, strain, and fit quality.

Export tools: save fitted parameters and spectra as CSV.

1.4 Typical Workflow

Load Data: Import wavelength-resolved transmission files (.fits, .tiff, .npy, etc.).

Select ROI: Choose single points or regions for analysis.

Fit Bragg Edges: Apply fitting models to extract lattice spacing.

Visualise Results: Display fitted edges and 2D maps.

Export Output: Save results for further analysis or publication.

1.5 Intended Users

NEAT is intended for:

Researchers and engineers performing Bragg-edge imaging experiments.

Beamline scientists conducting in-situ studies at neutron imaging facilities.

Industrial users analysing strain, phase evolution, or microstructural variations in materials.

2. GUI Overview

NEAT‚Äôs graphical user interface (GUI) integrates the entire Bragg-edge imaging workflow ‚Äî from loading and preprocessing data to edge fitting, mapping, and post-processing ‚Äî within a single interactive environment. It consists of three major tabs: data preprocessing, Bragg edge fitting, and data post processing.

2.1 Data Preprocessing Tab

The Data Preprocessing tab is the first step in the NEAT workflow. It consolidates all image-level corrections and normalisation steps needed before Bragg-edge fitting.
Each panel corresponds to a specific operation in the preprocessing chain, and users can execute them individually or as a complete automated batch using the Full Process module.

| Panel                   | Purpose                                                                                                               | Key Operations                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Summation**           | Combines multiple raw run files into one dataset to improve signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).                              | - Add multiple runs of the same measurement.<br> - Specify output directory and file name.<br> - Click **Sum** to merge all runs.                                                                     |
| **Clean**               | Detects and replaces dead or hot pixels in the detector images.                                                       | - Load the dataset to be cleaned.<br> - Apply **z-score thresholding** to identify abnormal pixels.<br> - Replaces flagged pixels with a local 5√ó5 mean filter.                                       |
| **Overlap Correction**  | Corrects pixel pile-up effects that occur in Timepix detectors when multiple neutrons arrive in one shutter interval. | - Load sample images.<br> - Apply the **Tremsin multiplicity-recovery algorithm** to restore accurate short-wavelength intensities.                                                                   |
| **Normalisation**       | Removes detector and beam profile effects by dividing the corrected sample stack by the open-beam reference.          | - Load sample and corresponding open-beam datasets.<br> - Set spatial (`n`) and wavelength (`m`) smoothing window sizes.<br> - Click **Normalise** to generate transmission images.                   |
| **Filtering (Masking)** | Optionally filters data to exclude invalid regions or apply binary masks for macro-pixel averaging.                   | - Load dataset and optional binary mask.<br> - Exclude non-sample areas (e.g. apertures or gaps).                                                                                                     |
| **Full Process**        | Automates all preprocessing steps sequentially for multiple datasets organised in a standard directory structure.     | - Choose parent folder and output location.<br> - Define base name and macro-pixel size.<br> - Click **Full Process** to run Summation ‚Üí Cleaning ‚Üí Overlap Correction ‚Üí Normalisation automatically. |

abstract = {The positions of Bragg edges in neutron transmission experiments can be defined with high accuracy using the time-of-flight (TOF) technique on pulsed neutron sources. A new dedicated transmission instrument has been developed at ISIS, the UK spallation source, which provides a precision of {$\Delta$}{\it d}/{\it d} {$\simeq$} 10${\sp {$-$}5}$ in the determination of interplanar distances. This is achieved by fitting a theoretical three-parameter expression to the normalized Bragg edges appearing in the TOF transmission spectra. The technique is demonstrated by experiments performed on iron, niobium and nickel powders. The applicability of using the instrument for the determination of lattice strains in materials has been investigated using a simple {\it in situ} loading experiment. Details of the calibration process are presented and the dependence of the resolution and the experimental times required by the transmission geometry on the instrumental variables are studied. Finally, the requirements for a Rietveld-type refinement of transmission data and the advantages and limitations over traditional neutron diffraction peak analysis are discussed.},

The tool is designed to provide rapid results, and it can be used on a range of computers, from personal laptops to high-performance computing clusters, with particular attention to memory management. This software is easily extendible to other spectral imaging applications. The use of {\it BEATRIX} is illustrated for a test specimen, providing spatially resolved 2D maps for residual strains and Bragg edge heights.},

The primary purpose of this instrument is to perform energy-resolved neutron imaging experiments through the effective utilization of the pulsed nature of the neutron beam, making this the world's first instrument dedicated to pulsed neutron imaging experiments. RADEN was designed to cover a broad energy range: from cold neutrons with energy down to 1.05 meV (or wavelength up to 8.8 Å) with a good wavelength resolution of 0.20% to high-energy neutrons with energy of several tens keV (or wavelength of 10-3 Å). In addition, this instrument is intended to perform state-of-the-art neutron radiography and tomography experiments in Japan. Hence, a maximum beam size of 300 mm square and a high L/D value of up to 7500 are provided.}

abstract = {The high spatial and temporal resolution of a neutron counting detector using microchannel plates (MCPs) combined with Medipix2/Timepix readout can substantially improve the spatial resolution of neutron transmission spectroscopy, as shown in our proof-of-principle experiments. Provided that the neutron fluence and data acquisition time are sufficient, transmission spectra can be acquired in each 55×55μm2 pixel of the detector, allowing high spatial resolution mapping of Bragg edge positions. Our first experiment demonstrates that energy resolution as high as ΔE/E<1% or ΔE<4mÅ can be achieved. Variation of the residual strain in a well-characterized VAMAS round robin shrink-fitted Al ring-and-plug sample was measured with ∼200 microstrain resolution through an accurate mapping of the first (111) Bragg edge. The measured stress profile agrees well with the expected values for that particular sample. More developments on the detector processing electronics are required in order to reduce the data acquisition times by enabling simultaneous measurements of spectra in a wide energy range covering multiple Bragg edges.}
